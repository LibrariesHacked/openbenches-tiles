â	THE WILD TABLE OF LOVE
BY ARTISTS, GILLIE AND MARC
#Love TheLast #WildTableOfLove
The Wild Table of Love by internationally renowned artists, Gillie and Marc, features a
banquet table full of delicious food, hosted by internationally beloved hybrid characters,
Rabbitwoman and Dogman. Sharing their table with ten of the most endangered animals in
the world, they are opening their hearts to the wild world, promising to protect them from the
threat of extinction. When we sit and share a meal, we share friendship and support. With two
empty seats at the table, you can join the family of love, becoming a protector of wildlife and
saving many species from the threat of extinction. This is part of the broader 'Love The Last'
project, a social movement driven by public art to raise awareness, funds and support for
endangered animals across the world, encouraging people to take action before we lose these
animals forever.
The Wild Table of Love serves as a beacon for a brighter future.
Help share their story through the hashtags
#Love TheLast and #WildTableOfLove
