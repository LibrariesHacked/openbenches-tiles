Hilaire Belloo"
Artist Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins combined scientific study, engineering ingenuity and imagination to design and build the models at Crystal Palace.
While others had reconstructed the skeletons of extinct animals, Hawkins was the first person to produce life-size sculptures showing how they might have looked when alive.
Hawkins believed striking, lifelike models would spark greater public interest in geology than the fragments of 'dry bones or oddly-shaped stones' displayed in museums of the time.

RICHARD OWEN (1804-1892)

Zoologist and anatomist Richard Owen acted as scientific advisor to the sculptor of the Crystal Palace animal models.
One of the best-known British scientists of the time, Owen had earlier coined the term 'dinosaur' to scientifically classify three extinct giant reptiles Hylaeosaurus, Iguanodon and Megalosaurus - which are all represented on this site.
He also developed much of the basic science that informed the models.
Publicity of the time attributed the design of the sculptures to Owen, but it is likely he only commented once the first prototypes had been produced. H"	& "	2E 4"	> "	  ("	
